# Sharded-Counter : Concurrency Unleashed

This Elixir project demonstrates the creation of a sharded counter using OTP (Open Telecom Platform) features, enabling concurrent operations for efficient counting. Sharding is a technique used to distribute the counter across multiple partitions or shards, allowing for parallel updates and efficient scalability.

## Project Overview

In this project, leveraged the power of Elixir and OTP to build a sharded counter that can handle concurrent increment and decrement operations. The counter is distributed across multiple shards, each maintaining a portion of the total count. This architecture enables high concurrency and efficient counting in a distributed environment.

## Features

- Sharded counter with concurrent operations
- OTP (Open Telecom Platform) for fault tolerance and supervision
- Distributed counting with parallel processing

## Why Pursue this Idea?

- **Unlocking the Full Potential of OTP with Elixir**: This project is a hands-on journey to harness the true capabilities of OTP using Elixir. It's an opportunity to dive deep into the world of concurrent, fault-tolerant systems.

- **Complexity Made Manageable**: The idea at the core of this project could be an overwhelming challenge with most other technology stacks. Elixir's elegant solutions make tackling this complexity not just feasible but intriguing.

- **The Art of Concurrency**: Elixir's simplicity belies its true strength, enabling us to master the art of concurrency. This project aims to make that power accessible and understandable, opening doors to highly efficient, parallel processing.

This project is not just about building a sharded counter; it's about embracing the elegance of Elixir and the raw power of OTP to tackle complexity, make the impossible feasible, and master the art of concurrent systems.
